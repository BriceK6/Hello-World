Kohn Reflection


	There have been many cases throughout my academic career where my final grade did not reflect what I have learned. I took a management class in undergrad about how other cultures work and how to adapt to different norms. I loved this class and the material came natural to me. I even received extra credit on the first exam because the professor had to set a curve to prevent a high number of failing grades. I ended up getting a D+ as a final grade. 
	
	There was a final project which was worth a large portion of the grade. I did my project on Nigeria because I had a co-worker who was Nigerian and I’ve always been intrigued by the country. Nigeria is a complicated country with 500 different languages spoken with many different tribes and cultures. I bit off more than I could chew. I spent a lot of time on the project and went into way too much detail. I enjoyed every second of my research until I had this mass pile of information. I was running out of time and I could not put together an organized finished product. Despite the amount of effort I put into the project, I received a failing grade for not finishing. This was a scenario where I tried really hard and ended up with negative results. The majority of my academic career has been doing as little as possible to pass classes. 

	Grades represent obedience. They are quantitative marks to prepare you for getting things done in a timely manner. The idea is that grades show that you can get things done fast and correctly. In my experience, I never cared about grades. I love learning but hated the structure of school. In second grade I wrote a poem associating school with prison. I’ve always championed myself on doing well in school without trying. I could not do my homework and skip class and still do well on tests. 

	I would do more work if grades were removed. I always saw school work in the sense of “the path of least resistance”. Instead of calculating what I needed to get on the finals to receive an A, I would calculate if I could pull off not doing assignments with the assumption of getting at least a B on the final. I had a 2.7 gpa in undergrad, but now that I think about it, that’s exactly what I planned out. 

	This was the easy way out. But also I was not on the right career path. I did well in the classes that I was interested in, but the other classes were just another check mark. My motivation has always been intrinsic. In fact, extrinsic motivations have never worked for me. I’ve always been a little rebellious and oppose forceful authority figures. Grades to me were always another manipulation tactic. Thats why I never cared about getting good grades and ultimately it destroying my motivation.
